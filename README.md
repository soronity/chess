# ðŸš€ Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- Git
- Node.js

## Clone the Repository

First, let's clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/soronity/chess.git`

## Setup the Backend

Start by navigating to the backend folder in your terminal and run the command:

`npm run start`

Now the backend is running!

## Setup the Frontend

Open a new terminal (don't close the first one, it's busy doing backend magic! âœ¨).

Navigate to the frontend folder and run the same command:

`npm run start`

## Access the App

Open your favorite browser and go to:

`http://localhost:3000`

And tada! Click on the pieces to move them. Open the menu to reset and undo moves. 

Sometimes the app stops working seemingly randomly. If that happens you have to restart the backend server and try again. 

Sorry if you lost your game progress! I'm working on solving these issues.
