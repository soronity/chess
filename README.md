# What is this?

It's an unfinished chess app that you can play locally in two tabs in the same browser. It's the first step in making it possible for two players to play online and possibly making a mobile app. Also, all legal moves are not present, like castling and en passe.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- Git
- Node.js

## Clone the Repository

First, let's clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/soronity/chess.git`

## Setup the Backend

Start by navigating to the app directory in your terminal, and then to the backend directory. Run the command:

`npm run start`

Now the backend is running!

## Setup the Frontend

Open a new terminal (don't close the first one, it's busy doing backend magic! âœ¨).

Again, navigate to the app directory and this time into the frontend directory. Run the same command:

`npm run start`

## Access the App

Open your favorite browser and open the following URL in two different tabs:

`http://localhost:3000`

And tada! Click on the pieces to move them. Open the menu to reset and undo moves. 

Sometimes the app stops working seemingly randomly. If that happens you have to restart the backend server and try again. 

Sorry if you lost your game progress! I'm working on solving these issues.

## Features to add

- Uh, all the correct legal moves of chess of course!

## Credits

The game utilizes the open-source chess.js library. The app is built with extensive help from ChatGPT.
